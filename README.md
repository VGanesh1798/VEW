# VEW
Database project for CS2300

## Requirements
This project has three primary requirements: nodejs, yarn, and mariadb. Below you will find instructions for setting up the project.

### Nodejs
On either Windows or Linux, simply install nodejs.

### Yarn
On either Windows or Linux, simply install yarn. Navigate to the frontend and backend folders and run the command `yarn` in both to install the required packages. After this, you can run `yarn start` in the frontend to start the frontend server and run  `node rest.js` in the backend to start the backend server.

### MariaDB
The hardest one to setup. Install MariaDB and on Linux, use the `mysql_install_db --user=mysql --basedir=/usr --datadir=/var/lib/mysql` to setup.
